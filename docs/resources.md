# Resources
With the Python SDK you will be able to consume the following API resources:

## Institutions
Bank entities that are supported by Belvo API.

### List
Retrieve all bank integrations available.

**Method:**
```python
def list() -> Generator:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
# Retrieve all institutions
institutions = client.Institutions.list()

```
**:warning: Warning:**

The `.list()` method yields a `Generator`, you will have to iterate  over it or
cast it to `List` or `Tuple`.


## Links
Links an end-user identity with a bank entity.

### Registering a new Link

To register a `Link` you **must** provide: _institution, username and password_. 
Optionally you can also provide a _token_ (for MFA) and a _secret_ (that will
be used to safely encrypt and decrypt the password).

The `Link` will only be registered if the provided credentials are valid and will
be validated by authenticating against the specified bank.

**Method:** 

```python
def create(
    self,
    institution: str,
    username: str,
    password: str,
    *,
    username2: str = None,
    username3: str = None,
    password2: str = None,
    token: str = None,
    save_data: bool = True,
    raise_exception: bool = False,
    access_mode: AccessMode = None,
    username_type: str = None,
    certificate: str = None,
    private_key: str = None,
) -> Union[List[Dict], Dict]:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
# Link that doesn't require a MFA token
link = client.Links.create("banamex", "johndoe", "a-password")

# Link that requires a MFA token
link = client.Links.create("bancomer", "johndoe", "a-password", token="37038919")

# Creating a recurrent link
from belvo.enums import AccessMode
link = client.Links.create("banamex", "johndoe", "a-password", access_mode=AccessMode.RECURRENT)

# Creating a Link with a username_type
link = client.Links.create("banamex", "johndoe", "a-password", username_type="001")

# Creating a Link with a certificate and private_key
link = client.Links.create("sat_mx_fiscal", "johndoe", "a-password", certificate="/path/to/cert", private_key="/path/to/key")
```

### Deleting links
A `Link` is persisted into our database when you register it, if you want you can 
delete it at any time and data related to the `Link` will be also deleted.

**Method:**
```python
def delete(link: str) -> bool:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
client.Links.delete("b91835f5-6f83-4d9b-a0ad-a5a249f18b7c")

```

**:warning: Warning:**

When deleting a `Link`, all _accounts_, _transactions_ and _owners_ data will be
deleted on cascade.

### List and filtering
In order to make easier to find a `Link` (or many of them), it is possible to 
filter the results.

If not filters are provided, you will get all `Links` that you have registered.

**Method:**
```python
def list(**kwargs) -> Generator:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
# Retrieve all links (no filter given)
links = client.Links.list()

# Retrieve links for a specific bank
links = client.Links.list(institution="banorte")

# Retrieve links for a list of banks
links = client.Links.list(institution__in="hsbc,banamex,santander")
```

**:warning: Warning:**

The `.list()` method yields a `Generator`, you will have to iterate  over it or
cast it to `List` or `Tuple`.

### Updating an existing Link

A `Link` is persisted into our database when you register it, if you want you can 
update it with new data, like a password change.

**Method:** 

```python
def update(
    self,
    link: str,
    *,
    password: str = None,
    password2: str = None,
    token: str = None,
    save_data: bool = True,
    raise_exception: bool = False,
    username_type: str = None,
    certificate: str = None,
    private_key: str = None,
) -> Union[List[Dict], Dict]:
```

**Example:**
```python
# Update a Link's password
link = client.Links.update("b91835f5-6f83-4d9b-a0ad-a5a249f18b7c", "a-password")
```

### Requesting link scoped tokens
A link token that contains `access` and `refresh` keys.
This link token is scoped to the link that created it and valid for the actions done with this link only.

**Method:**
```python
def token(link: str, scopes: str) -> Union[List[Dict], Dict]:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
link_token = client.Links.token(link="b91835f5-6f83-4d9b-a0ad-a5a249f18b7c", scopes="read_links")
```

## Accounts
Bank accounts available for a link.

### Fetching accounts
To fetch accounts you will make use of the `.create()` method, the process will
retrieve all account data available from the bank institution. You **must** 
provide a `Link`.

If the account already exists in our records, only its balance and `collected_at` 
will be updated.

**Method:** 

```python
def create(
    self, link: str, *, token: str = None, **kwargs: str
) -> Union[List[Dict], Dict]:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
# Fetch accounts for a Link
accounts = client.Accounts.create("b91835f5-6f83-4d9b-a0ad-a5a249f18b7c")

# Fetch accounts for a Link with and timeout after 15 seconds
accounts = client.Accounts.create(
    "b91835f5-6f83-4d9b-a0ad-a5a249f18b7c", 
    timeout=15
)
```

### Deleting accounts
An `Account` is persisted into our database after you fetch it, if you want you 
can delete it at any time.

**Method:**
```python
def delete(account: str) -> bool:
    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
client.Accounts.delete("161a5e4d-67f5-4760-ae4f-c1fe85cb20ca")

```

**:warning: Warning:**

When deleting an `Account`, all transactions_ and _owners_ data will be deleted 
on cascade.

### List and filtering
In order to make easier to find a `Account` (or many of them), it is possible to 
filter the results.

If not filters are provided, you will get all `Accounts` that you have registered.

    ...
```

**Example:**
```python
# Retrieve all accounts (no filter given)

accounts = client.Accounts.list(institution="banorte")


# Retrieve all checking accounts with an available balance >= 100
accounts = client.Accounts.list(type__in="checking", balance_available__gte=100)
```

**:warning: Warning:**

The `.list()` method yields a `Generator`, you will have to iterate  over it or
cast it to `List` or `Tuple`.

## Transactions

### Fetching transactions
To fetch transactions you will make use of the `.create()` method, the process will
retrieve all transaction data available from the bank institution. You **must** 
provide a `Link` and a date range defined by `date_from` and `date_to`. 

Optionally, if `Account` is given it will only fetch transaction matching 
the account.

If the account retrieved in the transaction doesn't exist, it will be created
with the transaction.

**Method:** 

```python
def create(
    self,

## Statements
List of monthly statements for a given account

### Fetching statements
To fetch statements you will make use of the `.create()` method, the process will

is needed in those cases to provide the required `token` during the login.
`session`, `link` and `account` parameters will be needed to resume the process.

**Method:** 

```python
def resume(

**:warning: Warning:**

The `.list()` method yields a `Generator`, you will have to iterate  over it or
cast it to `List` or `Tuple`.

## WidgetToken
A widget token that contains `access` and `refresh` keys. Use `access` to connect the Belvo Widget to your app. 

### Creating a new token
To create a new widget token you need to use the `.create()` method, the process will
request a new token to our API. This token has a limited scope and a short time to live. 

**Method:** 

```python
def create(
    self,
    *,
    raise_exception: bool = False
) -> Union[List[Dict], Dict]:
```
